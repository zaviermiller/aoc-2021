# AOC 2021

This year I'm doing the challenges in Rust! I really like the concept behind the memory stuff, and needed an excuse to get learnin.

### Running

This program generates a new Rust struct with the two methods that will be called when you run the challenge.

To generate: `cargo run [day]`

To run the challenge for a day: `cargo run run [day]`
